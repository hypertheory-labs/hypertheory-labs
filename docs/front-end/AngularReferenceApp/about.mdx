Over at [Github](https://github.com/hypertheory-reference/angular) we are building a sort of "reference" application.

The idea is to have a centralized repository where we can demonstrate various things about Angular Development, discuss it, and _evolve_ it over time.

We are going to make great effort to keep this is a _living_ thing, including keeping it up to date.

This section of our resources collection will be articles discussing various things that show up in the reference application.
