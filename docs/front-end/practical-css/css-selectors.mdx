# Mastering CSS Selectors

:::info
Throwing concepts in here, will add a Stackblitz _Dojo_ later for
folks to practice this stuff
:::

Direct children only

```
div > span {
background-color: red;
}
```

Sibling selector, selects all p siblings after div in the document order - but not p siblings before the div

This is because CSS reads your file from top to bottom

```
div ~ p {
  background-color: blue;
}
```

/_ only select first sibling after div element that is a p, for each div element _/

```
div + p {
  background-color: pink;
}
```

Select each element that does not have the class of .green.

These can be chained together.

```
p:not(.green) {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

Attribute selector

```
input[type='text'] {
  background-color: purple;
}
```

Any element that has a type attribute

```
input[type] {
  margin: 30px;
}
```

match by data attribute and value

- "\*" means match any part of the value
- ^ means match if it starts with the value
- $ means match if it ends with the value

```
input[data-margin*='sd'] {
  margin: 30px;
}

input[data-margin^='sd'] {
  margin: 30px;
}

input[data-margin$='df'] {
  margin: 30px;
}
```
