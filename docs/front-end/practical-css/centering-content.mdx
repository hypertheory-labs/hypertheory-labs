# Centering Content

## Centering with Flexbox

### Centering along the x-axis

**Case:** Grace, the UX designer, ran a user UX lab for the articles page.
Based on user feedback, she has asked you to center the `h1` article title
on the articles page so that it is displayed more prominently to readers.

<iframe
  style={{ width: '100%', height: '500px' }}
  src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/web-platform-vdumqb?embed=1&file=flex-x-axis.css&initialpath=flex-x-axis.html"
></iframe>

CSS:

```css
.someClass {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

Tailwind:

```html
<div class="flex justify-center"></div>
```

### Centering on y-axis

**Scenario:** Dembe, the tech lead, identified that the icon next to the navigation
link is not in alignment. One of the stakeholders has a keen eye for detail, and Dembe knows
that it will be flagged in the review if it's not fixed.

He's asked you to provide a fix before the review later today.

<iframe
  style={{ width: '100%', height: '500px' }}
  src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/web-platform-vdumqb?embed=1&file=page2.html"
></iframe>

CSS:

```css
.someClass {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

Tailwind:

```html
<div class="flex flex-col justify-center"></div>
```

### X & Y Axis

CSS:

```css
.someClass {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

Tailwind:

```html
<div class="flex items-center justify-center"></div>
```

## Centering with Grid

CSS

```css
.someClass {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

Tailwind:

```html
<div class="grid place-items-center"></div>
```

## Centering with Float

Don't.
