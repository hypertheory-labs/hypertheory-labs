# Centering Content with Grid

Author's Note: Uhm... This isn't ready yet. Can you look away for a minute? Thanks.

## Centering with Grid

CSS

```css
.someClass {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

Tailwind:

```html
<div class="grid place-items-center"></div>
```

## Centering with Float

Don't.
