# Centering Content with Flexbox

## Horizontal Centering

**Case:** Grace, the UX designer, ran a usability lab for the articles page.
Based on user feedback, she has asked you to center the `h1` article title
on the articles page so that it is displayed more prominently to readers.

**Task:** Center the article title horizontally using flexbox.

<iframe
  style={{ width: '100%', height: '500px' }}
  src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/web-platform-vdumqb?embed=1&file=flex-center.css&initialpath=flex-center.html"
></iframe>

CSS:

```css
.article-title {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

Tailwind:

```html
<div class="flex justify-center"></div>
```

## Vertical Centering

**Scenario:** Dembe, the tech lead, identified that the icon and the navigation items are not vertically centered in the nav bar.
One of the stakeholders has a keen eye for detail, and Dembe knows that it will be flagged in the review if it's not fixed.

He's asked you to provide a fix before the review later today.

**Task:** Center the navigation item text and icon vertically within the nav bar.
