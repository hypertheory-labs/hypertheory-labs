Listen, I get it. You don't have the fedora, or the half-lit cigar.
You just wanna center some content on the screen, because that's what the designer wants
and he's not gonna budge.

**Practical CSS focuses on using modern CSS solutions to everyday problems.**

In this learning path, you'll learn:

- How to center stuff
- Layouts with Flex and Grid
- Even (_sigh_) how do to all this in Tailwind
