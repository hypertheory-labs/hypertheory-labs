We are just figuring this stuff out.

Here's the story. The three of us (Lee, Jamie, and Jeff) are friends, and we talk about programming, and we do some programming together.

We've collaborated on a few things, we set up a Discord for just us, and we found that even when we aren't _working_ together, that _learning together_ is fun, and we learn more than if we are just trying to learn on our own.

In a very informal way, we started having some discussions about what we are working on, but not just in a "hey, I found this code works better than this!" sort of way, but also we started to have discussions at a slightly higher level. By bouncing our personal practices off of each other, by sharing our experiences of what has worked well, and - maybe more importantly - what hasn't, we were really accellerating our own learning and our ability to deliver high-quality code.

We decided to start [this site](https://hypertheory-labs.com), open up our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/NWksZJAh) and we are going to use these to share our experiences, and to share our thoughts on programming, and to share our thoughts on learning to program. And most importantly, to create a community of people what are working as software developers to practice continual learning and improvement.

We are going to try to keep it informal, and we are going to try to keep it fun, and we are going to try to keep it interesting.

We want you to join us. Here, at the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/NWksZJAh), and join our conversation. You can ask questions, you can share your own stuff, and you can just hang out and listen.

Let's see how this goes!
